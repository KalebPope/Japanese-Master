      <h1>What is the Japanese Language?</h1>
      <p> The Japanese Language is a language which is the official language spoken in Japan. It has around 123 Million speakers
        and is used in popular media such as anime and manga. The language is heavily influenced by chinese which shows especially
        in its written language.
      </p>

      <h1>The Writing scripts: explained</h1>
      <p>Japanese has 3 writing scripts: Hiragana, Katakana and Kanji. These are different from the one writing system of english,
        which uses an alphabet to construct words.
      </p>
      <h1>Lets look at an example of all 3 being used</h1>
      <p>
        <span className="text-red-400">私 </span>
        <span className="text-green-400">は </span>
        <span className="text-red-400">毎日 </span>
        <span className="text-yellow-300">テレビ </span>
        <span className="text-green-400">を </span>
        <span className="text-red-400">見 </span>
        <span className="text-green-400"> ます</span>
        </p>
        <p>Translation: I watch TV everyday</p>
      <p>Looks scary right? with some practice, this sentence can be easy to understand!</p>
      <p>First lets look at the first writing system: Hiragana. these are highlighted in green. It is mainly used for grammar, which
        in this example is used to introduce a topic, conjugate a verb and show the use of a direct object.
      </p>
      <p>The characters highlighted in yellow are Katakana, which are used mainly for foreign borrowed words and scientific words.
      </p>
      <p>The final characters are the hardest to get but are the most common. They are called kanji and make up the words of the language.</p>
      <p>Each of these 3 scripts are essential to master to read and understand the language.</p>

      <h1>Bonus: History of Japanese language</h1>
      <p>Although little is known about when Japanese was first used, at first it was a spoken language. Then around the 3rd
        century BCE Japan established relations with China, which brought heavy influence in the culture and language of Japanese.
        In the 4th century it is estimated that the written language of classical chinese was introduced and quickly became the first
        written language used by the elite. Later, classical chinese characters would be adapted into the written language of
        japanese.
