                 <p className=" pt-5 max-w-200 font-intervariable text-black font-medium"> While there are a few exeptions (notably the Y row and the W row), Each row corresponds to a constanant: K, S, T, N, and so on.
                  In this lesson and the future Hiragana lessons, we are going to learn each row and learn how to pronounce it, write it and recognise it.  </p>

                 <p className="pt-5  max-w-200 text-lg font-intervariable">The Japanese language is an unusual language in that it has three systems of characters to write sentences.
                  All 3 are essential to not only read Japanese, but be able to understand better so you can speak it.  </p>
                  <h1 className="mt-10 p-5 text-2xl italic border-l-4 border-red-500">"But 3 writing systems seems complicated!"</h1>
                  <p className="pt-5 max-w-200 text-lg">Although a lot of beginners, when they first hear that theres 3 different writing systems might think, <em>"Thats too hard!"</em> or <em>"Im not smart enough for that..."</em>, in reality it's much simpler if we take a step back and break it down.
                     </p>
                     <h1 className="text-4xl pt-5 font-black text-red-500 font-intervariable">Writing system #1: Hiragana</h1>

                     <h2>- An example of Hiragana characters</h2>
                      <p className="pt-5 max-w-200 text-lg">Hiragana is the first of these writing systems and its the first one most beginners learn. It consists of 46 phonetic characters, which have sounds attached to them and are used mainly for grammatical endings, 
                        native words and furigana. <small className="italic">(we will learn about furigana in later lessons.)</small>  </p>
                      <p className="pt-5 max-w-200 text-lg">Attatched below is a full chart of the basic Hiragana characters that one must learn to read Hiragana: </p>
                      <img src="/images/courses/Lessons/Introduction/Hiragana-chart.png" className="w-100 h-150"></img>
                      <a href="https://www.busuu.com/en/japanese/alphabet/hiragana" className="text-md text-blue-400 underline italic">Make your own later</a>
                       <p className="pt-5 max-w-200 text-lg">Each of these with the exeption of the vowels and a few other characters are made with a constanant and vowel pair. 
                        What this means is that each row starts with its respective vowel, e.g. K and ends in a vowel e.g. a. join them together to get Ka! </p>
                         <h2 className="pt-5 max-w-200 text-3xl text-red-500 font-extrabold">Pronounciation</h2>
                          <p className="pt-5 max-w-200 text-lg">When pronouncing each character is important to hear what it sounds like, as this is the basis of knowing how each sound is pronounced so you can hear words other people are saying. </p>
                          <h2 className="mt-5 text-6xl font-extrabold border-l-4 pl-4 border-red-500">あなた</h2>
                           <p className="pt-5 max-w-200 text-lg">Here is an example of the word <span className="underline">Anata</span>(You). </p>
                           <p className="pt-5 max-w-200 text-lg"> The three characters in this example are あ、な and た. A is a vowel, followed by our vowel and constanant pairs, na and ta.  </p>
                           <p className="pt-5 max-w-200 text-lg">We will dive deeper into learning all the characters in the <span className="underline">next lessons</span>, but for now we are going to move on to the next writing system!</p>
                           <h1 className="text-4xl pt-5 font-black text-red-500 font-intervariable">Writing system #2: Katakana</h1>
                           <img src="/images/courses/Lessons/Introduction/katakana.png" className="w-80 h-30 mt-5"></img>
                     <h2>- An example of Katakana characters</h2>
                           <p className="pt-5 max-w-200 text-lg">Katakana is the next writing system is is very similar to Hiragana. it uses the exact sounds as Hiragana but uses sharp, angular lines as opposed to curvy, freeflowing lines. </p>
                           <p className="pt-5 max-w-200 text-lg"> Katakana is used mainly for: 
                           <ul className="list-disc space-y-4 pt-4">
                            <li>Foreign borrowed words テレビ - Television</li>
                            <li>Onomatopoeia キラキラ - Sparkle</li>
                            <li>Foreign names ジョン - John</li>
                           </ul>

                      <h1 className="text-4xl pt-5 font-black text-red-500 font-intervariable">Writing system #3: Kanji</h1>
                      <h1 className="text-[200px]">日本</h1>
                     <h2>- An example of a Kanji word: Japan</h2>
                      <p className="pt-5 max-w-200 text-lg">Here is the writing system that every beginner looks at and feels like this language is too hard. You might hear thousands of characters, difficult to read, and that it makes up around 40% of 
                        a Japanese text. While all this is true, its not actually as bad as it sounds and also what makes this language unique. 
                      </p>
                       <h1 className="pt-10 max-w-200 text-xl">We will get into more detail about Kanji in later courses but just know that they exist and you can definitely master them! <em className="text-sm">(Who knows, you might even come to like studying them!)</em></h1>

        <h1 className="text-4xl pt-5 font-black text-red-500 font-intervariable">Putting it all together</h1>
        <p className="pt-5 max-w-200 text-lg">Now that we have seen the 3 writing systems, its time to see them all together in an example sentence.
                      </p>
        
                      <p className="pt-5 max-w-200 text-5xl">
                      <span className="text-red-500">私</span>
                      <span className="text-green-500">は</span>
                      <span className="text-yellow-300">テレビ</span>
                      <span className="text-green-500">を</span>
                      <span className="text-red-500">見</span>
                      <span className="text-green-500">ます</span>
                      </p>
        <p className="pt-5 max-w-200 text-lg">Translation: I watch TV.
                      </p>
        
                      <p className="pt-5 max-w-200 text-lg">Looks scary right? with a bit of explaining and practice you will be able to read this sentence!
                      </p>
        
                      <p className="pt-5 max-w-200 text-lg">The first part of this is 私は and it consists of the Kanji 私 and the hiragana particle は. The 私 kanji means "I", while the hiragana particle は is a topic marker, which marks the topic of the sentence.(dont stress if you
                        dont know what that means yet!) </p>
                        
                      <p className="pt-5 max-w-200 text-lg">  Next we have the katakana word テレビ, which means TV. this is followed by the hiragana particle を, which marks a direct object.(dont worry about what this means, we will understand it in a later lesson!) </p>
                      <p className="pt-5 max-w-200 text-lg">   Finally the Last 
                        part of this sentence is 見ます, which contains the kanji 見 and the hiragana ま and す. This is a verb, which means to see and has the present tense ます. 
                      </p>
        
                      <p className="pt-5 max-w-200 text-lg">How did it go? did you understand it? Dont stress if you didnt, as we will explain in much more detail in the coming lessons on how to read sentences like this!</p>
