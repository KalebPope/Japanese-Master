        <p>Now that we know a little more about the language, we are going to get into the foundations that are needed to
            learn the Japanese language
        </p>
        <h1>What is Hiragana?</h1>
        <p>Hiragana is the basic phonetic script that represents all the sounds in Japanese.</p>
        <h1>Hiragana chart</h1>
        <p>This hiragana chart displayed shows all the 45 characters and should be used as a guide to learn the characters</p>
        <h1>First, lets look at the 5 vowels of Japanese:</h1>
        <h2>あ い う え お</h2>
        <p>Click on the characters to hear the pronounciation:</p>
        <p>Nice! now that we know how they sound, we can now look at the next row</p>
        <h1>The K row</h1>
        <p>か き く け こ</p>
        <p>Click on the characters to hear the pronounciation:</p>
        <p>You may notice that there is a pattern: we make a k sound followed by a vowel sound. This pattern holds true for most
            of the rows in the chart however there are exceptions like other languages.
        </p>
        <p>The S row</p>
        <p>さ し す せ そ</p>
        <p>Using the rule used in the k row, you may think that the し character is pronounced: Si. However as stated there are exceptions
            so this character is pronounced "Shi". This is the only exception for this row.
        </p>
        <p>The T row</p>
        <p>た ち つ て と</p>
        <p>Now in this row there are two exceptions: ち and つ. These are pronounced "Chi" and "Tsu" respectively. Click on the
            hiragana to hear how they sound to hear the difference as you will want to hear the different sounds.
